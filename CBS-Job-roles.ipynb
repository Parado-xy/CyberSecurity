They confirm that vulnerabilities identified in vulnerability scans are real weaknesses worth addressing. They also uncover any other vulnerabilities missed by vulnerability scans and other assessments. After pen testing is complete, they report their findings to the organization so that it can address discovered vulnerabilities before attackers target them. \n","\n"," \n","\n","- Position: Depending on an organization’s structure, a pen tester can be an entry-level, mid-level, or advanced role."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Application security engineer\n","\n","Like a security software developer, an application security engineer is concerned with software security.
